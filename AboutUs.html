        <div class=home><h1>About Us</h1><h2>
        The 2nd disc golf team at Borderland State, known as the B2 Bombers, was formed in the winter of 2011. We play through out the winter in the organized league that is known as "Team Challenge". There are currently 4 pools (A-D), each with 8 teams. The higher the letter, the better the competition. At the end of each year, the top 2 teams in each pool move up (except in A pool) and the 2 bottom teams in each pool move down. The actual season starts in October and ends in April. During the season we will play 1 match a month against a team from another course. Through out the season, we will have 3 home matches, 3 away matches and 1 neutral course match. </h2>

<div class="panel">
  <p>
          <i>1st round</i> - singles, match play. One v. one round between members of opposite teams. Each hole is worth 1 point. If player A finishes a hole in 2 strokes and player B takes 4, player A is awarded 1 pt (not 2). If both players score the same on a hole, neither gains a point and play continues at the next hole. The match ends when either all 18 holes have been played or 1 player is mathematically eliminated from winning.<br> Example: If Player C is up by 3 points to player D and they only have 2 holes left, player C automatically wins because even if player D wins the last 2 holes, they will still lose that individual match. If you win your match, your team gets 1 point. In the event of a tie, both teams are given .5 point. <br><br>
          <i>2nd round</i> - doubles, stroke play. Two vs. two doubles match where each player on a doubles team takes a shot from each lie and the next shot is taken from the best of the 2 shots. A doubles match will always play at least 18 holes because the score is overall strokes instead of overall holes (like in the 1st round.) In the event of a tie, the match goes to sudden death. The next team that scores lower on a hole, wins the match. If your doubles team wins their match, your team gets 2 points (1 for each player).<br><br>
        At the end of both rounds, the team points are tallied to determine a winner. In the event of a tie, a sudden death, doubles match is played to determine the winner.</p>
